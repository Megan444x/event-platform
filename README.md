This Rust project leverages the Actix-web framework to build a highly efficient and performant web server designed for comprehensive event management. Focused on tackling the challenge of handling extensive concurrent user traffic, especially noticeable during peak times of event registrations, this server ensures responsive and robust API service delivery. With a core emphasis on scalability, security, and speed, our implementation aims to provide seamless event registration, updates, and management capabilities. Through the use of Rust's powerful type system and Actix-web's asynchronous processing features, we strive to offer a superior backend solution that maintains agility and reliability under heavy load, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience for event participants and organizers alike.
